# Artificial Neural Netweorks and Deep Learning Competition
In this repository there can be found the *Jupyter Notebooks* used by me and my collegues to participate to the competition of Politecnico di Milano course *Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning* (2023/2024).

## Image Classification
**Goal:** build a binary classifier to correclty classify images of leaves according to their healthy status.

**Dataset Deitails**: 
- Image size: 96x96
- Color space: RGB
- File Format: JPG
- Number of classes: 2
- Classes: 0: "healthy"; 1: "unhealthy"

| Class number | Class name | Training images |
| ------------ | ---------- | ---------------- |
| 0 | Unhealthy | 2001 |
| 1 | Healthy | 3199 |

**Evaluation**: The metric used to evaluate models is the Accuracy. 

**Final result**: In the end with our neural network model we achieved an accuracy of 84% on the final test set.
